homepage footer copyright etc
embeds dynamic browser size, flow? flex? frontpage important
general left selection bar for speedruns, strats, marathon runs : how should it look?
-> filter instead of selection bar? : game title, genre, year, etc. whatever is in the array as attributes
-> save all runs / podcasts / articles / strats in an array and do things dynamically instead of adding new pages
check out my stream frontpage black background text
support page : donation button img, same with patreon etc., text too dark and too long
Do something with font of topheader Bubzia - Blindfolded Speedruns

convert input for marathon runs etc, in json format outside of source code
add sidemenu to articles (interview, article, ...)
for now delete Youtube Tab, add selection like marathon, articles etc. to Twitch/ Speedruns Page
podcast : spotify / youtube sidebar
article: interview / news sidebar
